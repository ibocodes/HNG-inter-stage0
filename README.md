# STAGE ONE
## 🧩 Overview  
This project is part of the **HNG Frontend Internship Stage 1** task.  
It builds upon my **Stage 0 Profile Card** by extending it into a **multi-page web application**.  

The project includes:  
- A **Contact Us** page with form validation using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
- An **About Me** page that reflects my journey, goals, and thoughts as a frontend developer.  

Each page is built with **semantic HTML**, **accessibility best practices**, and **responsive design** principles.
